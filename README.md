# trinity_blast_dataframe_sequence_machine_learning
This repository contains a scalable and faster implementation of the genome and the transcriptome annotations for large scale sequencing datasets. a parallelly implemented python function for the API based blast analysis of
the transcripts and provides a faster and comprehensive approach to the blast analysis and filter analysis based on the similarity score. It takes a transcriptome assembly file and provides a transcriptome wide dataframe as well as the analysis plus the  accession and the sequences of the blast analysis and alignment. It also provides a complete information on the taxID and also the  blast sequences. It will also write and get the accessions identified in the blast hists and also the sequences for the alignment. Give the assembled  genome coding regions, or the transcripts or the genes and it will prepare the  clean headers, transcript headers, blast analysis, accession analysis, taxonomy identifiers analysis.

Support for the tokenizers and sequence based machine learning.
